#Encountered difficulties:

- first use of typescript which turned out to be complicated for me.
- While debugin, I forgot to changes branches and to commit everytimes so that leads to branches conflicts 

#Area of ​​improvement of the app:

- use getStaticPath to display conversations by id (avoid re-rendering the form & button in each conversation)
- better writing  of my react components
- Write tests for each components and containers (units tests, integration tests, end to end tests) to ensure that the app is reliable
- Responsive for tablet and mobile

***This test was a great way to see my potential. I've many axes to improve and I will continue to pratice and creating project to  keep constructing solid fondation on JS/React.

thanks to you LBC team for your time
